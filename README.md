# computer

my computer setup, mostly using brewfile.

feel free to fork this and swap out the `Brewfile` for your own setup!

**[read more about how it works with my blog post.](https://7.dev/brewfile/)**

## usage

### starting with a new computer

```sh
$ ./install       # install packages
```

### install new brews/casks

```sh

$ ./add-cask cask-name
```

## file management/utils

```sh

```
